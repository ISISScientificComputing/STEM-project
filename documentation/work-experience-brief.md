Working to help design and implement an outreach activity that can be used by the ISIS Computing department at STEM events.
The project will be to create a mock ISIS instrument in software that can be controlled and used for analysis through simple 
python scripts. Once complete this resource would be used in roughly hour long sessions aimed at people with little to no programing 
experience. The aim of the activity will be to teach students about the work that happens at ISIS and additionally,
give them the opportunity to develop some programming skills in python.

As a work experience student, your task will be to help implement, test and document a part of this system.
The system will be written in python and there may be the opportunity to work with some hardware in addition
to the software requirements.

At the end of your time on site, you will be given the opportunity to give a brief
informal presentation on the work that you have completed while you were here and what you have learnt.
This presentation will be delivered to a few members of the team that are currently working on the project.
